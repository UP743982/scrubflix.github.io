# scrubflix.github.io
Software Engineering Coursework. Web Application "SCRUBFLIX" shows information about current and upcoming movies.

# Web based application written html5/css and javascript languages.
# Design folder consist of differnet design patterns to be implemented on the website. During implementation stage Design folder will include number of different design patterns, however in the final stage of the implementation only those used in the prototype will be left in the folder.
# Image folder consist of movie posters used in the prototype. It will change consistently due to the nature of the software.
# Theme folder consist of css stylesheets implementing 'change theme' feature of the application.
# I order to implement dynamic design, number of stylesheets have been created. Below presented which stylesheet works which files.
# Style.css - index.html
# Style2.css - top20.html
# Style3.css - genre.html


# ****** HOW IT WORKS ******
# Scrubflix web app is written in html/css and javaScript languages. Back end is written using mySQL and Visual Studios. 
# During video presentation of the application narrator walked through the app features.
# "Movies" and "Top20" pages are connected to the database. Loading time is fast. Each movie have unique id in the database. It is all pointed out during video presentation.
# It is important to point out that "Genres" page is not connected to the databse therefore loading time increased significantly (around 10 seconds).
Other pages in comparison load data from the databse and loading time goes down to minimum (faster than 1 second).
# "Change theme" feature works under number of different stylesheets.
# ****** HOW IT WORKS ******

# ****** THINGS TO DO ******
# There are "Search" bar on the front page of the website. It does not work and need further development to the system.
# There was also idea to make login page for the web app. It was not implemented because of two reasons: 
1. Scrubflix is public app and does not contain any data regarding user security or privacy therefore login feature is not essential.
2. Did not have enough time to implement it.
